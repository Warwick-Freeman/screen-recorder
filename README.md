# screen-recorder
Sample electron-forge app to capture the screen

I copied it from a sample at:-
https://codingshiksha.com/javascript/build-a-screen-recorder-desktop-app-using-electron-forge-node-js-full-project/

and got it working with the latest electron and node js

To use it you need to first clone it and then npm init it to download the various things
